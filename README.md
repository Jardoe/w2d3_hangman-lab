# SnowMan Lab
A less violent variation on the classic hangman game. It is done in Ruby and uses the terminal to play the game.

## About
This was a full-day paired programming exercise. We were given the task of creating the logic for a hangman-style game.
We ultimately were able to achieve creating a runner file for the game and used an ASCII snowman sprite to depict the number of lives; after each lost life another part of the snoman melts!

  _[]_
W (\")
|-(:')-<
| ( ')

_[]_\nW (\")\n|-(:')-<\n|('  )"

I had a lot of fun producing this, and I'm still impressed with myself after realising I had only coded for 7 days prior to writing this task.
